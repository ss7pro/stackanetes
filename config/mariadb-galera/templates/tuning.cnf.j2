## Generally, it is unwise to set the query cache to be larger than 64-128M

## gains.
## The query cache is a well known bottleneck that can be seen even when 
## concurrency is moderate. The best option is to disable it from day 1 
## by setting query_cache_size = 0 (now the default on MySQL 5.6) 
## and to use other ways to speed up read queries: good indexing, adding 
## replicas to spread the read load or using an external cache.
